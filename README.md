A CSS animation for rendering a projector like effect to a freshly created logo

We chopped up the freshly created logo into three different .png files and placed them into three different divs.
divs containing the class of projector (id="one" and id="two") were given the same css animation which changed the height and opacity of the divs at various times. The two animation for the second div was started at a 0.1s delay to give it more of a projection like effect.
