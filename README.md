A CSS animation for rendering a projector like effect to a freshly created logo

The freshly crated logo was chopped up into three different .png files and placed into three different divs.
The two divs with class="projector" (id="one" and id="two") were given the same css animation which changed the height and opacity of the divs at various times. The two animation for the second div was started at a 0.1s delay to give it more of a projection like effect.
